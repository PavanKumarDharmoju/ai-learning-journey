## Creating the environment through Command line

It's been so long since i used only command line for things like git(I mainly use github desktop), I forgot most of the commands todays challenge achieves the following things

1. Create files and use git through commandline
2. Start with the basics of pytest (need to get stronger in pytests)
3. Start this journey of learning to hone my skills
